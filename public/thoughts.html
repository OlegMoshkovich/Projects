              <p class = "thoughts">Often, we get too attached to the roles forgetting the contextual nature of expriences.</p>
              <!-- <p class = "sketch" style="text-align:center;"> <img src="images/sketches/midtown.png" width = "20%" alt="" style="border: 1px solid grey;"></p> -->
              <p class = "thoughts">Important is to learn from the present and to view experiences through the systemic lens, with the input, output, and process that translates one into another.</p>
              <!-- <p class = "thoughts"style=" text-align: left; padding-left:150px;"> <img src="images/sketches/cost_function.png" width = "330px" alt="" style="border: 1px solid grey;" ></p> -->

              <p class = "thoughts"> The hope is for the engineering mindset combined with the architectural point of view to enable one to cut through the clutter and to get to the core of the structure, uncover the gaps and devise the way to bridge them.</p>
              <p class = "sketch"style=" text-align: center;"> <img src="images/sketches/diagram.png" width = "40%" alt="" style="border: 1px solid grey;" ></p>

              <p class = "thoughts"> It is the best when empathy is present in the approach, with out it the world would be grim, cold and too rational.
              Do not forget to remind oneself not to assume and listen with patience.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts">The systemic evolution will occur not only by the invention of new technological artifacts but also through paying attention to the culture and context specific education.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts"> Intriguing are the organizations committed to solving complex problems. Impressive are the products - able to adapt to different challenges and contexts.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts">Interests lie on the intersection of space, people and technology. It seems the future is behind augmentation of people and space with sophisticated technological accessories.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts"> The background is in Product, Architecture, and Engineering.
              Experiences range from complex legacy systems to technology start ups.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts">At one point I experienced the inner workings of Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where I led the team of engineers and architects through the development of the digital ecosystem for Grand Central expansion Mega Project - it was challenging and fascinating.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts">The start up experience included participation in the inception and the development of an intricate product ecosystem and what was referred to as hybridizes culture.
              Eventually, the product reached maturity and the company was aquired by American International Group.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts"> Amazing is our ability to communicate through various methods and share the knowledge in a simple and concise way.</p>
              <p class = "thoughts"> Today I heard a phrase - living between the moments - it resonated.</p>
