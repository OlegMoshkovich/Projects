Important is to learn from the present and try to view experiences through the systemic lens, with input and output and the process that translates one to another.

The hope is for the engineering mindset combined with an architectural point of view to enable one to cut through the clutter and to get to the core of the structure, to understand how it functions and how it can be improved.

It is the best when empathy is present in the approach, with out it the world would be grim, cold and too rational.
Do not forget to remind oneself not to assume and listen with patience.

The systemic evolution will occur not only by the invention of new technological artifacts but also through paying attention to the culture and context specific education.

Intriguing are the organizations committed to solving complex problems. Impressive are the products - able to adapt to different challenges and contexts.

Interests lie on the intersection of technology and people...It seems the future is behind augmentation of people with sophisticated technological accessories

The background is in Product, Architecture, and Engineering.
Experiences range from complex legacy systems to technology start ups.

At one point I experienced the inner workings of Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where I led the team of engineers and architects through the development of the digital ecosystem for Grand Central expansion Mega Project - it was challenging and fascinating.

The start up experience included participation in the inception and the development of an intricate product ecosystem and what was referred to as hybridizes culture.
Eventually, the product reached maturity to generate value to the customers and the company was acquired by American International Group also known as aig.

Amazing is our ability to communicate through various methods and share the knowledge in a simple and concise way.
